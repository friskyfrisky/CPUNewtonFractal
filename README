dependencies 
	EasyBMP (will automatically install, have git installed on system)
	g++

run run.sh. edit the file to change the index of the variable we are changing, output resolution etc
edit newt.cpp to se variables like render resolution, etc, we recompile every time we run because it's fast and you might want to edit the function
